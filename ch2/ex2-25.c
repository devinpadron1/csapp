/* Exercise 2.25
 *
 * Consider the following code that attempts to sum the elements of an array
 * a, where the number of elements is given by parameter length.
 *
 * When run with argument length equal to 0, this code should return 0.0.
 * Instead, it encounters a memory error. Explain why this happens. Show how
 * this code can be corrected.
 *
 * Explanation: TODO
